# Angular-Pokedex

### About
Angular-Pokedex is a web application that uses the [Pokéapi](http://pokeapi.co/) for all data except images. I did not care for the image quality of Pokéapi so have opted to pull images from the [Pokédex](http://www.pokemon.com/).

I wanted to create a nice looking simple project using AngularJS and Angular Material. Seeing as the Pokéapi is an easy to use GET only RESTful API it was the perfect resource. 

Hope you enjoy using Angular-Pokedex, please feel free to leave comments or suggestions on improvements.
